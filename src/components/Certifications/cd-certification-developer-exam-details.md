## Preparing for the Exam

The CD Overview provides a bird's-eye view of all your Builds — successful, failed, aborted, and expired — and the percentage of successful builds for individual codebases. You can easily see where your builds have failed and drill down into specific builds to troubleshoot and analyze the root causes.
