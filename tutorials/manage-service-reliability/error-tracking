## Exception Types

Uncaught exceptions are the exceptions that are not caught by the compiler but automatically caught and handled by the Java built-in exception handler.

Caught exceptions are handled in code via the `try` and `catch` keywords.

Swallowed exceptions are caught in empty `catch` blocks. They don't show up in logs. These can be particularly nasty to identify and troubleshoot.


## Identify, Prevent, Resolve

### Identify Critical Issues
Proactively identify runtime exceptions and slowdowns in every release â€“ Including issues that otherwise would be missed. Know when new releases introduce new, increasing or resurfaced exceptions. Get alerted only on your most critical exceptions. Find issues missed by logs and APM with out-of-the-box integration.

### Prevent Issues with Quality Gates
Static analysis and testing can never cover 100% of issues. Runtime Code Analysis identifies your unknown issues, and prevents them from being deployed. Get out-of-the-box code quality report for every release. Automatically block unreliable versions from being released. Integrate with your CI/CD and static analysis tools to bolster-up your Shift-left initiative.

### Resolve Using Complete Context
Reproduce any exception or slowdown with the complete source code, variables, DEBUG logs and environment state. Get complete context for every exception in pre-prod or production. Fix production exceptions, even if they were never logged. Get to the root cause with one click directly from your logs.


## Integrated with CI/CD Pipelines or Standalone
Error Tracking can be used as a standalone capability or it can be included as part of your CI/CD pipelines. Whenever your code is exercised, Error Tracking will identify every exception and provide supporting details you need to fix them.

## Key Features of Error Tracking

### Code Fingerprinting
Error Tracking analyzes code loaded into your JVM/CLRs at runtime and assigns a unique fingerprint to each line of code. At runtime, Error Tracking correlates each error and slowdown to its unique signature to identify anomalies and capture their complete state.

### Source Code & Variables
By analyzing and indexing the structure of your code, Error Tracking is able to collect the most relevant variable state information from running JVM/CLRs whenever critical events take place. Data is captured across the entire call stack up to 10 levels into heap.

### DEBUG/TRACE Logs
Error Tracking maintains highly efficient cyclical in-memory buffers of log statements to show you the DEBUG/TRACE state of your code at the moment of critical events, without increasing log verbosity or parsing log files from disk.

### Error Detection & Prioritization
Error Tracking correlates all code events at runtime to their unique fingerprint (even as code changes over time) to identify and prioritize new and spiking errors without relying on developer foresight to log and search for them.

### Host / Container State
Error Tracking captures detailed system metrics (e.g. CPU, GC) of the host / container in which your code is executing, as well as complete snapshots of the JVM/CLR state (e.g. env vars, threading state) at the moment of critical errors and slowdowns.


## AES Encryption. PII Redaction. Access Controls.

### 256-bit AES Encryption
All source code and variable state collected is privately encrypted using a 256-bit AES Encryption key before leaving the production node. Only you have access to secret encryption keys which are not stored by Harness.

### PII Redaction
Error Tracking redacts PII variable data before it leaves the user environment. Variable state is redacted based on configurable variable value patterns and code symbology: variable, field and class names. Designed for PCI and HIPAA-compliant organizations.

### Enterprise SaaS
The SaaS architecture enables you to use our high availability and secure infrastructure.
