A load balancer distributes user traffic across multiple instances of your applications. Load balancing reduces the chances of performance issues in your applications by spreading the load.

You can create a custom load balancer using the AutoStopping proxy option. This feature allows you to launch a VM with the load balancer.

Perform the following steps to create an AutoStopping proxy for your resources in AWS:



1. In the **Harness** application, go to **Cloud Costs**.
2. Under **Setup**, click **Load Balancers**.
3. Click **Create New Load Balancer**.
4. Select **AWS**.
5. Choose an existing connector or create a new one.
6. Click **Continue**.
7. Click **Create AutoStopping Proxy**. 
8. Click **Continue**.
9. In the** Create a new AutoStopping Proxy **window, enter the following information:
    1. Provide a name for the AutoStopping Proxy.
    2. Select your preferred DNS provider and perform the mapping:
        *  If you select **Route 53**, you must choose a hosted zone from the available zones and enter the domain name. AutoStopping manages Route 53 configuration automatically. 
        * If you select **Others**, enter the URL.
    3. Click **Continue**.

1.  Select the region where you have your cloud resources hosted.
2.  Select the **VPC** from the dropdown list.

Go to [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html) for more information. After successfully storing the secret, enter the **Secret ARN** in this field. \
