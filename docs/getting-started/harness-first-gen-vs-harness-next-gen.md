Harness has two versions of its product suite.

**Harness NextGen** is Harness' new version with a redesigned experience and new Continuous Integration, Feature Flags, Security Testing Orchestration, Service Reliability Management, Cloud Cost Management, and Chaos Engineering modules.

 If possible, sign up with Harness NextGen. Eventually, all Harness FirstGen accounts will migrate to Harness NextGen.![Harness NextGen ](https://files.helpdocs.io/kw8ldg1itf/articles/1fjmm4by22/1660058403021/harness-next-ge.png)
 
 **Harness FirstGen** is the Harness version that's been around for years, covering all of the common platforms.
