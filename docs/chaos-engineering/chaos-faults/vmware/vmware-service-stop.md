title: VMware service stop
---
VMware service stop stops the target system services running on a Linux OS based VMware VM.
- It determines the performance and resilience of the application (or service) running on the VMware VMs.

![VMware ServiceStop](./static/images/vmware-service-stop.png)

## Use cases

This fault helps determine how resilient an application is to random halts. It determines how efficiently an application recovers and restarts the services.



- Kubernetes > 1.16 is required to execute this fault.
- Execution plane should be connected to vCenter and host vCenter on port 443. 
- VMware tool should be installed on the target VM with remote execution enabled.
- Adequate vCenter permissions should be provided to access the hosts and the VMs.
- Create a Kubernetes secret that has the Vcenter credentials in the `CHAOS_NAMESPACE`. Below is a sample secret file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vcenter-secret
  namespace: litmus
type: Opaque
stringData:
    VCENTERSERVER: XXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERUSER: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
    VCENTERPASS: XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
### Note
You can pass the VM credentials as secrets or as a `ChaosEngine` environment variable.


- The VM should be in a healthy state.
- The target services should exist inside the VM.

### Service name
It contains the target service name running on a particular VM.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (./static/manifests/vmware-service-stop/vmware-service-stop.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# Service Stop in the VMware VM
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  chaosServiceAccount: litmus-admin
  experiments:
    - name: VMware-service-stop
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            # Name of the VM
            - name: VM_NAME
              value: 'test-vm-01'
            # Name of service
            - name: SERVICE_NAME
              value: 'nginx'
```
