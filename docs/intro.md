The Harness Delegate can be installed into a wide set of Kubernetes clusters. From locally on your machine such as minikube or k3d to a variety of cloud providers. The Harness Platform needs connectivity to talk to the Harness Delegate which can be configured for example if you are behind a proxy. For clusters on your own machine or ones readily available by public cloud providers, the Harness wirings will work automatically.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new pipeline**.

Or **try Harness immediately** with **[app.harness.io](https://app.harness.io)**.

### What you'll need

```js
import React from 'react';

enum docType {
  Documentation = 'doc',
  Interactive = 'interactive',
  Video = 'video',
}

type FeatureItem = {
  title: string;
  module: string;
  svg?: React.ComponentType<React.ComponentProps<'svg'>>;
  description: JSX.Element;
  type: docType[];
  link: string;
};
```
