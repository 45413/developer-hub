Harness subscriptions allow you to tailor the level of cover you need from each Harness module you use. For Feature Flags, you can subscribe and upgrade online directly through the Harness Platform instead of contacting our Sales team, meaning you can manage your subscription quickly, securely, and at any time. 

Using online subscriptions, you can choose whether to be billed yearly or monthly, and can select the exact number of licenses you need for your developers and for monthly active users (MAUs). It’s as easy as signing in to the Harness Platform, choosing your [subscription plan](available-plans-for-feature-flags.md), and entering your billing details.  

:::info note
Currently online subscriptions are available only to self-serve customers. If you are an enterprise buyer or want to subscribe to other modules, contact the Harness Sales team.
