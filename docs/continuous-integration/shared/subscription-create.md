   If you were actively using a Free plan before upgrading, Harness makes a recommendation based on your previous and predicted usage.

   If you would like to subscribe to the premium 24/7 support package, select **Add Premium Support**.

   The cost estimate updates based on the number of developers and whether you selected the premium support package. You can toggle between **Monthly** and **Yearly** billing. The price doesn't include tax; tax is calculated after you enter your billing details.

   Tax is calculated once you enter your billing zip code. This can take up to 10 seconds to calculate.

6. Select **Subscribe and Pay** to submit payment. Harness doesn't store payment information. Payments are handled by Stripe.
