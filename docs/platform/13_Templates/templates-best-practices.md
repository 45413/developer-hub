Template versioning in Harness is an important part of maintaining effective development processes. To ensure the best practices are followed, it is essential to have a clear and consistent workflow for managing templates. 

You can save your templates in remote Git repositories. For example, a core pipeline that you want all of your app pipelines to use. You can put the template in a core repository and reuse it in multiple pipelines.

Maintaining a good template management system is essential for your deployments.

Here are some of the best practices you can follow: 

- **Branches**: For different stages of development, use separate branches and merge them once they are ready.
- **Version control**: Maintain different versions of your templates in Git and track their changes.
- **Regular updates:** Regularly update your templates and fix any bugs to keep them up-to-date.
- **Sharing**: Share your templates with others in your organization or open-source them, to get feedback and make improvements.
- **Policies**: Set up policies that outlines who should create, manage, and review the templates before they are approved.
- **Track changes**: Make sure that changes are documented and tracked, so any future changes or updates can be easily identified.
- **Test changes**: When making changes to templates, make sure to test them thoroughly before approving them for use.
- **Backup changes**: Templates can be critical resources when you need them. Backing up your templates in multiple locations allows for quick and easy access when needed, reducing downtime during critical moments.
