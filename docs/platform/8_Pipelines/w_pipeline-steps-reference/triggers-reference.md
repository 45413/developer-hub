This topic provides settings information for Triggers. Triggers are used to initiate the execution of Pipelines.

For steps on setting up different types of Triggers, see [Triggers Howtos](/docs/category/triggers).

## Name

The unique name for the Trigger.

## ID

See [Entity Identifier Reference](../../20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md).

## Description

Text string.

## Tags

See [Tags Reference](../../20_References/tags-reference.md).

## Payload Type

Git providers, such as Azure, GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

## Custom Payload type

To use a custom payload type, copy the secure token and add it to your custom Git provider.

Whenever you regenerate a secure token, any preceding tokens become invalid. Update your Git provider with the new token.

## Connector

Select the Code Repo Connector that connects to your Git provider account.

See [Code Repo Connectors Tech Ref](/docs/category/code-repo-connectors).

:::note

Git webhook triggers do not support generic Git connectors. You must create provider-specific connectors for each provider (Github, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc) to use them with webhook triggers. For information on each Git provider connector, go to [Connect to a Git Repo](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Connectors/Code-Repositories/connect-to-code-repo).

:::

## Repository Name

Enter the name of the repo in the account.

Harness uses your Harness account ID to map incoming events. Harness takes the incoming event and compares it to ALL triggers in the account. You can see the event ID that Harness mapped to a trigger in the webhook's event response body `data`, for example:

```
{"status":"SUCCESS","data":"60da52882dc492490c30649e","metaData":null,...
```

Harness maps the `success` status, execution ID, and other information to this event (`data`) ID.

For details on each provider's events, go to:

* [GitHub - Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows)
* [GitLab - Events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html)
* [Bitbucket - Repository events](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/event-payloads/#Repository-events)

## Conditions

Optional conditions to specify in addition to events and actions. These help to form the overall set of criteria to trigger a Pipeline based on changes in a given source.

For example:

* Trigger a build when a specific value is passed in the source payload.
* Trigger a build when there's a change in a specific file or a pull request.
* Trigger a build based on a specific artifact tag convention.

:::caution Conditions are cumulative

Triggers are like complex filters in which all conditions are `AND`-ed together. To execute a trigger, the event payload must match *all* trigger conditions.

For example, the configuration in the following image requires that the event match all conditions for **Source Branch**, **Target Branch**, **Header Conditions**, **Payload Conditions**, and **JEXL Conditions** to activate the trigger.

![](./static/triggers-reference-11.png)

If you want a trigger that uses `OR`, `NOT`, or other operators across the payload, define only a **JEXL Condition** and leave the other conditions empty (unless you want to `AND` them to your JEXL condition).

The JEXL `in` operator is not supported in the **JEXL Condition** field.

:::

With the exception of JEXL conditions, trigger conditions include an **Attribute**, **Operator**, and **Matches Value**.

### Attributes

Some attributes are predefined and some require you to define a value.

#### Built-in Git payload expressions

To create dynamic triggers, Harness includes built-in Git payload expressions for referencing trigger details, such as a PR number.

* Main expressions:
  * `<+trigger.type>`
    * Webhook
  * `<+trigger.sourceRepo>`
    * Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Custom
  * `<+trigger.event>`
    * PR, PUSH, etc.
* PR and Issue Comment expressions
  * `<+trigger.targetBranch>`
  * `<+trigger.sourceBranch>`
  * `<+trigger.prNumber>`
  * `<+trigger.prTitle>`
  * `<+trigger.gitUser>`
  * `<+trigger.repoUrl>`
  * `<+trigger.commitSha>`
  * `<+trigger.baseCommitSha>`
  * `<+trigger.event>`
    * PR, PUSH, etc.
* Push expressions
  * `<+trigger.targetBranch>`
  * `<+trigger.gitUser>`
  * `<+trigger.repoUrl>`
  * `<+trigger.commitSha>`
  * `<+trigger.event>`
    * PR, PUSH, etc.

#### Referencing payload fields

You can reference any payload fields using the expression `<+trigger.payload.[path-in-json]>`, where `[path-in-json]` is the path to the field in the JSON payload, such as `<+trigger.payload.pull_request.user.login>`.

How you reference the path depends on:

* The payload format for the event type. Not all event types use the same payload format.
* The Git provider. Different Git providers send JSON payloads in different formats, even for the same event. For example, a GitHub push payload might be formatted differently than a Bitbucket push payload.

Always make sure the path you use works with the provider's payload format and the event type.

### Operators

Some operators work on single values and some work on multiple values:

* Single-value operators include **Equals**, **Not Equals**, **Starts With**, **Ends With**, and **Regex**.
* Multiple-value operators include **In** and **Not In**.

The **In** and **Not In** operators can take comma-separated and Regex values, such as `Not In master,release/.*`.

You can also use a Regex value to specify all files in a parent folder, such as `ci/*`.

If you want to specify multiple paths, use the **Regex** operator.

### Matches Value

Matches values are the values for the trigger to match. Acceptable values and value formatting depend on the condition type, attribute, and operator.

You can supply a single value, comma-separated values, and Regex values.

### Source Branch, Target Branch, and Changed Files Conditions

You can configure triggers to match the source branch, target branch, and/or changed files in a Git merge. Available conditions depend on the [event type](#event-and-actions) selected. For example, any event that belongs to a merge will have **Source Branch** and **Target Branch** conditions.

For example, the following image shows a trigger that would start a build if both of the following conditions were true:

* The source branch starts with `new-`.
* The target branch equals `main`.

![example source branch and target branch configurations](./static/triggers-reference-12.png)

### Header Conditions

While valid JSON cannot contain a dash (-), headers are not JSON strings and often contain dashes. For example, `X-Github-Event`  and `content-type` in the following payload:

```json
Request URL: https://app.harness.io:  
Request method: POST  
Accept: */*  
content-type: application/json  
User-Agent: GitHub-Hookshot/0601016  
X-GitHub-Delivery: be493900-000-11eb-000-000  
X-GitHub-Event: create  
X-GitHub-Hook-ID: 281868907  
X-GitHub-Hook-Installation-Target-ID: 250384642  
X-GitHub-Hook-Installation-Target-Type: repository
```

In the **Attribute** field, the header expression format is `<+trigger.header['key-name']>`, such as `<+trigger.header['X-GitHub-Event']>`. The following image shows how the expression `<+trigger.header['X-GitHub-Event']>` was derived from the `X-GitHub-Event` key in a GitHub webhook payload.

![Extracting trigger attributes from a GitHub webhook payload.](./static/triggers-reference-13.png)

If the header key doesn't contain a dash (`-`), then the following format also works: `<+trigger.header['key name']>`

When Harness evaluates the header key you provide, the comparison is case insensitive.

In **Matches Value**, you can enter a single value or multiple comma-separated values, and you can use wildcards.

### Payload Conditions

These conditions are based on the values of the webhook's JSON payload. Harness treats the JSON payload as a data model and parses the payload and listens for events on a JSON payload key.

To reference payload values, you use `<+eventPayload.[path-to-key-name]`, for example `<+eventPayload.repository.full_name>`.

For example, here is some data from a webhook payload that shows the repository owner:

```json
...  
>   "repository" : {  
>     "id": 1296269,  
>     "full_name": "octocat/Hello-World",  
>     "owner": {  
>       "login": "octocat",  
>       "id": 1,  
>       ...  
>     },  
...
```

To reference the repository owner in a trigger's payload condition attribute, use the expression `<+eventPayload.repository.owner>`, and enter a matching value in **Matches Value**.

The following image shows how the expression `<+eventPayload.repository.name>` was derived from the `repository:name` key in a GitHub webhook payload.

![Extracting trigger attributes from a GitHub webhook payload.](./static/triggers-reference-14.png)

The following image shows payload conditions that trigger a build if the comment body starts with `This` *and* the repository owner is `johndoe`.

![](./static/triggers-reference-15.png)

### JEXL Conditions

You can refer to payload data and headers using [JEXL expressions](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html). That includes all constants, methods, and operators in [JexlOperator](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/org/apache/commons/jexl3/JexlOperator.html).

Be careful when you combine Harness variables and JEXL expressions:

* **Invalid expression format:** `<+pipeline.variables.MAGIC.toLowerCase()>`
  * This expression is ambiguous. It could be evaluated as a Harness variable (return the value of variable `pipeline.variables.MAGIC.toLowerCase()`) or as a JEXL operation (return the lowercase of literal string `pipeline.variables.MAGIC`).
* **Valid expression format:** `<+<+pipeline.variables.MAGIC>.toLowerCase()>`
  * First, this expression gets the value of the variable `pipeline.variables.MAGIC`, and then it returns the value converted to all lowercase.

Here are some examples of valid combined JEXL and Harness expressions:

* `<+trigger.payload.pull_request.diff_url>.contains("triggerNgDemo")`
* `<+trigger.payload.pull_request.diff_url>.contains("triggerNgDemo") || <+trigger.payload.repository.owner.name> == "wings-software"`
* `<+trigger.payload.pull_request.diff_url>.contains("triggerNgDemo") && (<+trigger.payload.repository.owner.name> == "wings-software" || <+trigger.payload.repository.owner.name> == "harness")`

:::tip OR and NOT conditions

Triggers are like complex filters in which all conditions (Payload, header, branch, file, and JEXL) are `AND`-ed together. To execute a trigger, the event payload must match *all* trigger conditions.

If you want a trigger that uses `OR`, `NOT`, or other operators across the payload, define only a **JEXL Condition** and leave the other conditions empty (unless you want to `AND` them to your JEXL condition).

The JEXL `in` operator is not supported in the **JEXL Condition** field.

:::

## Pipeline Input

You can specify [runtime inputs]((../run-pipelines-using-input-sets-and-overlays.md)) for the trigger to use, such as Harness Service and artifact.

You can use [built-in Git payload expressions](#built-in-git-payload-expressions) and [JEXL expressions](#jexl-conditions) in this setting.

## Configure triggers in YAML

There is a YAML editor for triggers. When creating or editing a trigger, switch to **YAML** to access the YAML editor.

Here's an example of the YAML for a trigger.

```yaml
trigger:  
    name: GitlabNewTrigger  
    identifier: GitlabNewTrigger  
    enabled: true  
    description: ""  
    tags: {}  
    orgIdentifier: default  
    projectIdentifier: NewProject  
    pipelineIdentifier: testpp  
    source:  
        type: Webhook  
        spec:  
            type: Gitlab  
            spec:  
                type: MergeRequest  
                spec:  
                    connectorRef: gitlab  
                    autoAbortPreviousExecutions: true  
                    payloadConditions:  
                        - key: <+trigger.payload.user.username>  
                          operator: In  
                          value: john, doe.john  
                    headerConditions:  
                        - key: <+trigger.header['X-Gitlab-Event']>  
                          operator: Equals  
                          value: Merge Request Hook  
                    jexlCondition: (<+trigger.payload.user.username> == "doe" || <+trigger.payload.user.username> == "doe.john") && <+trigger.header['X-Gitlab-Event']> == "Merge Request Hook"  
                    actions: []  
    inputYaml: |  
        pipeline:  
            identifier: testpp  
            properties:  
                ci:  
                    codebase:  
                        build:  
                            type: branch  
                            spec:  
                                branch: <+trigger.branch>  
            variables:  
                - name: testVar  
                  type: String  
                  value: alpine
```

## Webhooks

For all Git providers supported by Harness, the webhook is automatically created in the repo. You usually don't need to copy the URL and add it to your repo's webhook settings.

### Automatically registered Git events

The following Git events are automatically added to the webhooks that Harness registers.

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```
```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="github" label="GitHub" default>
```

[GitHub events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads):

* `create`
* `push`
* `delete`
* `deployment`
* `pull_request`
* `pull_request_review`

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gitlab" label="GitLab">
```

[GitLab events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html):

* Comment events
* Issue events
* Merge request events
* Push events

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Bitbucket" label="Bitbucket">
```

* [Bitbucket Cloud events](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/event-payloads/):
  * `issue`
  * `pull request`
* [Bitbucket Server events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/event-payload-938025882.html):
  * Pull requests
  * Branch push tag

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="YAML" label="YAML">
```


```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Manual and custom webhook registration

Here's a summary of the manual webhook registration process if automatic webhook registration fails or is impossible (as with custom webhooks).

1. In Harness, obtain the trigger webhook by selecting the **Webhook/Link** icon in the list of triggers.

   ![](./static/triggers-reference-16.png)

2. Log in to your Git provider and navigate to the repo's webhook settings. For example, here's the **Webhooks** section of GitHub.

  ![](./static/triggers-reference-17.png)

3. Add a webhook. In the webhook settings, paste the webhook URL that you copied from Harness into the payload URL setting in the repo. Make sure that you select JSON for the content type. For example, in GitHub, you select **application/json** in **Content type**.

#### Custom webhook URL format

The format for the custom webhook URL is as follows:

```
https://app.harness.io/pipeline/api/webhook/custom?accountIdentifier=<accountID>&orgIdentifier=<orgID>&projectIdentifier=<projectID>&pipelineIdentifier=<pipelineID>&triggerIdentifier=<triggerID>
```

The `orgIdentifier` and `projectIdentifier` are mandatory.

The `pipelineIdentifier` and `triggerIdentifier` target the webhook at the specific pipeline and trigger.

In some cases, you won't want to target the webhook at the specific pipeline and trigger. For example, there are events in GitHub that are not covered by Harness and you might want to set up a custom trigger for those events that applies to all pipelines and their triggers in a project. To instruct Harness to evaluate the custom trigger against all pipelines (until it finds matching **Conditions**), remove `pipelineIdentifier` and `triggerIdentifier` from the URL before adding it to your repo.

## Last Activation

On the list of triggers for a pipeline, you can see when each trigger was last activated.

**Activation** means the trigger was able to *request* pipeline execution; it doesn't mean that the webhook didn't work.

**Failed** usually means the pipeline has a configuration issue that prevented the trigger from initiating a build.
