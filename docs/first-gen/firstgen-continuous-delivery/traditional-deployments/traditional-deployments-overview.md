The following topics discuss how to perform Traditional deployments using application package files and a runtime environment (Tomcat, JBoss) in Harness.

These deployments are different from Harness deployments using container orchestration platforms like [Kubernetes](/article/7in9z2boh6-kubernetes-quickstart), [Helm](/article/2aaevhygep-helm-quickstart), [Pivotal](/article/hy819vmsux-pivotal-cloud-foundry-quickstart), [AWS ECS](/article/j39azkrevm-aws-ecs-deployments), and [Azure](/article/kiuft72fr5-azure-deployments-overview).

Traditional deployments involve obtaining an application package from an artifact source, such as a WAR file in an AWS S3 bucket, and deploying it to a target host, such an AWS AMI.

For an overview, see [Traditional Deployments (SSH) Overview](/article/aig5tw1zvo-traditional-deployments-ssh-overview).
